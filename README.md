# Analysis of Shift Load using Belavia Flight Schedule

This project is a tool for analyzing the workload of document verification staff based on the flight schedule of Belavia airline. The program collects information about arrivals and departures of flights and divides them into day and night shifts to facilitate the process of analyzing shift load.

To work with the flight schedule and gather data, the Selenium library is used, which allows automating interactions with web pages. The program opens the Belavia airline web page, selects the necessary parameters (e.g., dates and destinations), and then gathers flight information using the provided data.
